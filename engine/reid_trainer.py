    - Cross-entropy + Triplet loss with uncertainty weighting
    - P-K sampling (P identities, K images per identity)
    - Feature extraction for metric learning
    - Embedding = [CLS_SA; CLS_GLCA] (concatenated features)
    
    Training procedure:
    1. Sample P identities with K images each (P*K batch)
    2. Forward pass through SA, GLCA, PWCA branches
    3. Compute ID classification loss (cross-entropy)
    4. Compute triplet loss on embeddings
    5. Combine losses with uncertainty weighting
    6. Update model
